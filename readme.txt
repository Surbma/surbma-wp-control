Very useful fixes and add-ons for WordPress Multisite installations.

== Description ==

This is a very complex plugin, which is very useful for any installations, but mainly for Multisite Networks. I have created this plugin for my own WordPress installations and I'm continue to add more useful functions to it in the future. This plugin is not for the average WordPress user, but for a WordPress developer or site managers. You need a basic knowledge to use WordPress Multisite, FTP and other things to fully take advantage of this plugin.

**Here is a list of the current functions:**

- Global Google Analytics tracking for all your blogs. You have to define the SURBMA_PWP_CONTROL_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS constant in the wp-config.php file. Just use the UA code, nothing else!

**Do you want to contribute or help improving this plugin?**

3. That's it. :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin good for? =

This plugin was created especially for my Multisite Networks, but works for all WordPress installations. It can control some minor, but important parts of a WordPress website, which is very useful if you handle a lot of client websites.

= What does Surbma mean? =

It is the reverse version of my last name. ;)
